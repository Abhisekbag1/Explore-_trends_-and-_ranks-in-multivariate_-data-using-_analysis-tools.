## 🧪 Experiment Description
This program is designed to explore trends and ranks in multivariate data using popular data analysis libraries. The goal is to:
- Identify significant patterns in the data
- Rank variables by importance or correlation
- Apply multivariate techniques to reduce dimensionality and highlight trends

---

## 🔁 Steps Followed

1. **Import Libraries**
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`

2. **Load Data**
   - Read dataset into a DataFrame using `pandas.read_csv()`

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values, check data types, normalize or scale features as required

4. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Compute mean, median, mode, std deviation, skewness, kurtosis, etc.

5. **Correlation Matrix**
   - Use `df.corr()` and visualize using a heatmap

6. **Trend Analysis**
   - Use line plots, scatter plots to explore trends over time or other dimensions

7. **Ranking Variables**
   - Rank features using correlation coefficients, variance, or PCA loadings

8. **Visualize Correlations**
   - Use seaborn’s heatmap and pairplot to visualize variable relationships

9. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and detect trends

10. **Summarize Findings**
   - Describe key insights, variable importance, and patterns identified
